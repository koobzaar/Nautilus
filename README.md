# Nautilus
Alternative to Steam Cloud for cracked games. The goal is to create and synchronize a folder in the cloud, and from there, save the progress of all supported games directly in the cloud. Nautilus solves the problem that most games not managed by Steam, Epic Games etc. have: the diversity of save locations, through a catalog maintained by the community. With Nautilus, it is possible to save and restore your progress in games without worrying about where they are located.
